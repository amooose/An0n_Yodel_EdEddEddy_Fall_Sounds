## Features
**Sound volume are tied to the ingame SFX volume setting by default!**  
Press Y to Yodel! You'll stand still while you yodel, and the distance people can hear you yodel is the same distance as voice chat.  
Random Ed Edd & Eddy fall damage sounds!

## Usage
Press Y to Yodel.  
Taking fall damage plays a random Ed Edd & Eddy sound  
(Sound wont play twice in a row for a single player by design)


### 2. Config Settings  
`enableFallDmgSounds` = Enables or disables the fall damage sounds.  
`allowYodel` = Allows the Yodel or not.  
`useGameSFXVolume` = choose whether to use the ingame SFX volume, or the below volume setting.
`yodelAndFallVolume` = Volume of the yodel and fall damage sounds. 0.0-1.0, by default it is 1.0
